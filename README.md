### About Me


Throughout my time as a financial solutions consultant Iâ€™ve achieved great success, spending three years as a top performer in sales and customer experience. I leveraged this recognition to offer freelancing as a business development consultant. One of my clients wanted to create a virtual showroom for their product, so I took it upon myself to learn an animation program to meet their needs. This project ended up being so fascinating and rewarding that it sparked my pivot into the tech space. My newly gained technical skills enabled me to fill gaps in clientsâ€™ business growth. Coupling business acumen with software engineering allowed me to broaden the impact of my solutions while delivering a user-friendly experience. I look to keep that same energy at your organization by collaborating with your team to implement intuitive products customers can rely on.
